# Q-learning Reinforcement Learning

Git Hub repository is https://github.com/Amari-Lawal/Baes-System-Project.git

Rock Paper Scissors game that implements Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning between two CPU's.

## Tutorial


1. Using Anaconda run: conda create -n q_learning-env -f q_learning_game.yml
2. Or run in Google colab(provides most dependencies)
2. In cmd/bash run: python q_learning_game.py


## Documents

The Presentation,evaluationa and time managment are in the Baes Notes folder

## Data

In increment_results.csv it shows the data recorded I've tested throughought to showcase the agents progress
In overall_results.csv its hows the results after each run or every 50000 games of Rock Paper Scissors
In Q_table.csv is stores the q_table or the log of each run of 50000 games which can be used in the future with more data to improve the agent further.
